# 👩‍💻 Mohammad Faisal - DevOps Engineer & Cloud Automation Enthusiast 🚀

Hi, I'm Mohammad Faisal, a passionate **DevOps Engineer** and **Cloud Automation Enthusiast** with a focus on **AI**, **MLOps**, and **AIOps**. I thrive on solving complex challenges by automating workflows, optimizing cloud infrastructure, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like machine learning and AI into operational pipelines.

### 🌟 What I Do:
- **Cloud Infrastructure Automation**: Architect and automate scalable cloud environments using **Terraform**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Build and manage **Docker** containers and orchestrate deployments with **Kubernetes**.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Creation**: Implement automated build, test, and deployment workflows for faster releases and improved quality.
- **MLOps & AIOps Integration**: Build pipelines for deploying, monitoring, and scaling machine learning models, as well as leveraging AI to automate system monitoring and predict potential failures.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **CloudFormation** to create repeatable, scalable, and secure infrastructures.

### 🔧 What I’m Working On:
- Building a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** with **GitLab CI** to streamline code deployments.
- Exploring the integration of **AIOps** with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to create predictive monitoring and proactive incident management systems.
- Contributing to **open-source cloud-native tools** and **DevOps best practices**.

### 💡 Why I Love DevOps:
DevOps for me is about **collaboration**, **innovation**, and **scalability**. The ability to create systems that not only work but also evolve autonomously to meet the demands of growing applications is both thrilling and rewarding. I believe **automation**, **cloud computing**, and **AI** are the future of engineering, and I’m committed to pushing the envelope in these areas.
